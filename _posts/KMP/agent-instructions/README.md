# KMP/OHOS Knowledge Base

## Purpose
This knowledge base serves as a centralized repository for KMP and OHOS domain knowledge, organized for efficient retrieval and maintenance.

## Current Structure
- `kmp-foundations/` - Core KMP concepts, compiler internals, and design principles
  - `kmp-structure.md` - KMP shared module architecture
  - `working-with-kotlin-native-compiler.md` - Building and testing Kotlin Native compiler
  - `adding-llvm-pass-to-konan.md` - Adding LLVM passes to the compiler
  - `llvm-runtime-libraries.md` - LLVM compiler-RT libraries for OHOS
  - `working-with-clang.md` - Building C/C++ programs for OHOS
  
- `ohos-integration/` - OHOS-specific integration patterns and APIs
  - `ohos-kmp-integration.md` - General KMP-OHOS integration
  - `running-exe-on-ohos.md` - Deploying and running executables on OHOS devices

- `best-practices/` - Proven practices and guidelines
  - `kmp-ohos-best-practices.md` - Development best practices for KMP/OHOS

- `quick-reference/` - Code snippets, FAQs, and quick lookup materials
  - `cheatsheet.md` - Quick reference for common commands and procedures

- `frequent-issues/` - Common problems and their solutions
  - `common-troubleshooting.md` - Troubleshooting guide for common issues

- `new-insights/` - Recently discovered information awaiting categorization
  - `insights-log.md` - Log of new insights and discoveries
  - `template.md` - Template for adding new insights

## Usage Guidelines
1. When encountering a new KMP/OHOS concept, search existing categories first
2. Add new content to `new-insights/` initially, then categorize later
3. Use consistent formatting and tagging across all documents
4. Cross-reference related topics within the knowledge base
5. Update existing documents when new information becomes available

## Search Tips
- Use specific terms when searching within the knowledge base
- Look for related topics in the "See Also" sections
- Check the `frequent-issues/` section first for common problems
- Review the `best-practices/` section for recommended approaches
